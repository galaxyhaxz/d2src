Reverse engineered Diablo II launcher and source code precursor

## About

This was my first reverse engineered C code project. In this repo you will find the source code to `Game.exe` for Diablo II version 1.00.

It can be assembled with Visual Studio 6 and will produce a binary exact executable.

I gave up and moved on to Devilution (Diablo I) after realizing how large and complex Diablo II was.

TODO: missing libraries for function linking.
